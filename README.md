**email_smtp_server.py**
----------------------------------
- Your Must Have to Turn on 2-step Verification on Your Gmail Account. (Log in -> Google Account -> Security -> Signing in to Google => 2-step Verification)
- Then Go to App Passwords. (Log in -> Google Account -> Security -> Signing in to Google => App passwords)
- Go to Select app (Pick 'other (customer name)') Then Type 'server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL('smtp.gmail.com', 465)'.

This Worked for me.
